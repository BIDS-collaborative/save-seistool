The fft routines called by fftf.f were causing problems when reading
large data files, like 24 hours of 100 SPS data. Some extra high-frequency
noise would be added to the data after it had been transformed. Testing for
memory access errors using rtc did not indicate a problem there.

I replaced the local fortran fft routines with the separate library fftw,
single precision version. And I linked to the static library to avoid having
to copy libfftw* to all the places seistool could possibly be run.
